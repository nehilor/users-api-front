## Features

- User login and logout functionality
- Displaying a list of users with their details
- Creating new users
- Updating existing users
- Deleting users

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- Redux: A predictable state container for managing application state
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript
- Material-UI: A popular React UI framework
- React Router: A routing library for handling navigation in the app

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm package manager

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd users-app
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and set the following environment variables:
